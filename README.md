# Maketree Go

**Maketree Go** is a CLI tool to generate directory and file structures from a simple specification file.

It is a **Go rewrite** of the [original Python version](https://github.com/Anas-Shakeel/maketree-cli), aiming for faster startup, single-file binaries, and easier cross-platform use.

> ⚠️ Work in progress. The tool is **not** yet ready for production use.
